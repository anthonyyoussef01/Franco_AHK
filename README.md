# Franco AutoHotKey
This is an AutoHotKey script that makes it more comfortable for people who regularly type Franco-Arabic to write Arabic easily.

While this script started as a joke, it actually works... Decently.

## Huh?

Franco-Arabic is a way of writing Arabic using English letters and numbers. Many people use it so much that they become uncomfortable using the arabic keyboard layout, which has radically different positions for all the letters. This script makes it so that you can write Arabic using a system very similar to Franco-Arabic.

## How it works

Writing english letters instantly write their arabic counterparts (for example, "t" --> "ت", "h" --> "ه")

Letters that usually form a different pronounciation are converted automatically as well (for example, "th" --> "ث"), but you can cancel out of it and go back to "ته" by pressing backspace.

Pressing shift + a letter will cycle through different variants of it. For example pressing "A" will form "أ", and typing "AA" will form "إ", and so on.

A longer example: "Ana bs 3ayz afhm ent 3mlt elbrnamg dh lih" --> "انا بس عايز افهم انت عملت البرنامج ده ليه"

Another example: "5laS ya 3m msh 7z3lk" --> "خلاص يا عم مش حزعلك"
